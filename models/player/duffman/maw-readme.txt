Madjai's Note:

This is my second player model released, but I have other works in progress right now. The skin was provided by Grafox, and I simply changed the colour of a few things to make the Blue Duffman.  There is some clipping issues with the cape, but thats hardly a problem.  Also you'll notice his face has some wierd shadows on them, I can't explain them or fix them so you'll just have to ignore them. Thanks for the great skin Grafox!!
