Security Player Model

I kind of wanted to base this reskin on the security guards from 24: Season One at the secret underground jail where they were holding Drazen. It is not an exact duplicate of those guards, mind you, so dont come bitchin to me saying that they look nothing like them, because they arent supposed to. It's just my interpretation. Enjoy!
