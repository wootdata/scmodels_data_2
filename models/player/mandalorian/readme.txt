Mandalorian


It's a dreadful feeling when you work hard on something and someone pips you to the post by mere hours!

Which is exactly what Doug Hillyer did with his Boba Fett model.

I basically converted Dan Bickell's superb Quake2 Boba Fett model using his Return of the Jedi skin into HalfLife format because it was on the top of the Cold Fusion Wishlist. I E-Mailed Dan to get his approval before I distributed it. In the meantime, while I was waiting for a reply, Doug's model arrived on the scene - NIGHTMARE! 

I was going to scrap the thing. Doug's Boba is a great model and there REALLY isn't any need for two. However, as I'd put the work in I figured, what the hell! I'll make him a Mandalorian - which for the uninitiated, is the race of warriors from which Boba Fett originates. 

At around 700 faces, the model is VERY high-poly - more so than I would normally be happy with, but hell! I'm just the converter. So here's what I propose - Use Doug's as the low-poly Boba Fett and Dan's as a high-poly version. Or set fire to your computer and run around in your knickers for an hour. - whatever takes your fancy.

The model and skin are the creation of Dan Bickell

Installation:

unzip the zipfile into sierra/half-life/valve/models/players

The zipfile will automatically create a folder called Mandalorian and place the Mandalorian mdl and bmp files inside along with this readme file.

Have fun
